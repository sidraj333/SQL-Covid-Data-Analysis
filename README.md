# SQL-Covid-Data-Analysis

In this project, I utilized MS SQL Server to analyze statistics and data for covid-19. This data was obtained through the CDC and it spans throughout 2 years.
Specifically, I utilized 2 tables. One table provides information about vaccinations in each country. The second table provides information about deaths in each 
country.
